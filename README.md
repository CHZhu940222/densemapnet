# DenseMapNet
Keras code for my paper on **_"Fast Disparity Estimation using Dense Networks"_** to presented at International Conference on Robotics and Automation, Australia, 2018 (ICRA 2018)

**_DenseMapNet_** is a tiny network (only 290k parameters) that can predict disparity (hence, depth) in real-time speed (>30Hz on NVIDIA 1080Ti) given a stereo images.
